# Suggestion Contract

`find-community-help` writes hints into a dedicated advisory channel. The channel must stay clearly separate from core instructions, persona files, and permanent memory. The skill was formerly named `agent-travel`; hosts may preserve legacy markers while migrating.

## Preferred Storage

Use this file path when the host can read a repo-local advisory file:

`./.agents/find-community-help/suggestions.md`

Store lightweight run state here when the host supports repo-local state:

`./.agents/find-community-help/state.json`

If the host supports only a single context file, embed the same block inline under exact markers.

## Required Markers

```md
<!-- find-community-help:suggestions:start -->
...
<!-- find-community-help:suggestions:end -->
```

Legacy `agent-travel` markers are accepted for backward compatibility.

## Canonical Shape

## suggestion-1
title: Refresh the skill snapshot after edits
applies_when: The host changed SKILL.md and the new content is still missing.
hint: Start a fresh session or restart the host before assuming the edit failed.
confidence: medium
manual_check: Confirm the host rescanned the skill directory and the file timestamp changed.
solves_point: The current thread is blocked on whether the host has reloaded the edited skill.
new_idea: Treat stale skill behavior as a host reload problem and verify the scan path before changing the skill again.
fit_reason: This fits when the user already edited the skill locally and needs a fast low-risk check before more changes.
match_reasoning:
- host: matched the same skill-host reload surface
- version: matched the same host build family where scan timing matters
- symptom: matched stale behavior after a local edit
- constraint_pattern: matched the current reload and filesystem scan boundary
- desired_next_outcome: matched a low-risk reload check before more edits
version_scope: Any host build where skill reload still depends on filesystem scan timing.
do_not_apply_when: Skip this hint when the host has already confirmed a fresh reload and the symptom now points to skill logic instead of cache staleness.

- primary_official_discussion: https://example.com/maintainer-thread

The fields above `## suggestion-1` belong to the top-level envelope. The fields under each `## suggestion-n` heading belong to that suggestion item only.

Optional fields such as `trigger_reason`, `visibility`, `fingerprint_hash`, `reuse_gate`, `private_source_opt_in`, and `consent_basis` should not break older hosts. Hosts that do not understand them should preserve them when possible and ignore them otherwise. Older hosts may still emit an earlier mode field that mirrors `search_mode`.

Evidence labels use `tier_source_kind`. The tier must be `primary`, `secondary`, or `tertiary`; the source kind must describe the authority surface, such as `primary_official_docs`, `primary_github_advisory`, `primary_official_github_release`, `primary_clawhub_metadata`, `secondary_stackoverflow`, `secondary_github_issue`, `secondary_clawhub_review`, `secondary_research_paper`, or `tertiary_blog`. Search engine result pages are discovery surfaces only and should not be stored as evidence.

Timestamps must include an explicit timezone offset. The canonical `problem_fingerprint` shape is `host|version|symptom|constraint_pattern|desired_next_outcome`; validators keep accepting at least 4 non-empty segments for older hosts. `fingerprint_hash` should be formatted as `h64:<64 lowercase hex chars>`. Each suggestion needs at least two distinct evidence sources: one `primary` evidence item and one independent non-`primary` cross-validation item. Local or sanitized session identifiers are fixture metadata, not evidence references. The current standardized `reuse_gate` value is `min_4_of_5_axes_and_ttl_valid`.

`tool_preference: public-only` is the default. `tool_preference: custom` or `tool_preference: all-available` requires `private_source_opt_in: true` and `consent_basis: user_explicit_request` or `consent_basis: user_explicit_private_source_opt_in`.

## Validator Scope

`validate_suggestions.py` checks structure, scope, freshness window, evidence labeling, and minimum cross-validation shape. It does not verify that cited sources factually support the hint; the host must read and review sources before storing the hint.
